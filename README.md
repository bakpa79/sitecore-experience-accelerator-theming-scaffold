# sitecore-experience-accelerator-theming-scaffold

Gulp based scaffold for theming Sitecore Experience Accelerator Projects.

Put the agency drop files and folders in the /static folder, and modify the gulpfile "sass" and "sass-compiled" tasks to point to the new theme you create.
Hint, rename the base theme, and over-write the contents of the individual files you are working on.
